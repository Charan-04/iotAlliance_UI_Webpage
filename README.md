(INCOMPLETE) </br>
Creating the webpage given using the framework of our choice
HTML and CSS are enough for making this webpage.</br></br>
**HTML**</br>.
Font awesome and bootstrap CDN have been added</br>
I have made three container header-container,middle-container and info-container.</br>
I have used a submit button for login, input text for search and title(EduX) with the help of bootstrap Grid.</br>
The middle container has a image in the back and a bar below with details like platform,duration,perks and a en-roll button. I have used given a background colour to this with a opacity to make the img visible.</br>
In the third container i have again split the screen in two sides. The left side contains About the course and Reviews and the Right Side contains the ‘course By’ and the Timeline.</br>
I have applied flex-direction:column to both the sides.</br></br>
**CSS**</br>
I have added some basic properties to match the features as shown in UI.</br></br></br>

**I couldn’t complete the project in the stipulated time, hence i am submitting the project till where it is done.**
